Live Theme Preview allows users to preview themes on their own website before customizing or activating them.

== Description ==

With Live Theme Preview, you can select a theme in an interface based on the Theme Customizer in WordPress. A sidebar shows all installed themes (or, with multisite - allowed themes), to preview, edit or activate.

See the screenshot, or install and try it for yourself.
